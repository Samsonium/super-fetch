# Super Fetch
The Super Fetch library is a lightweight ESM library (7.6 kB) that provides a strict and secure interface for making
HTTP requests using the [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API).

## Features
- **API**: fetch based on API repository with an opportunity to define query parameters,
  express-like path parameters, success and error response bodies and request body.
- **Simple**: a simplified way to make calls using `.get`, `.post` and other REST API methods.
- **Linked sequence**: A codependent request environment in which old requests cannot overlap new ones.
- **Long polling**: Customizable long-polling requests.

### Documentation
Work on documentation still in progress, but you can see useful examples on
[super-fetch documentation](https://samsonium.github.io/super-fetch/).

### Installation
You can install the Super Fetch library via npm:
```shell
npm i @samsonium/super-fetch
