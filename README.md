- ✅ **API**: fetch based on API repository with an opportunity to define query parameters,
  express-like path parameters, success and error response bodies and request body.
- 🏗️ **Simple**: a simplified way to make calls using `.get`, `.post` and other REST API methods.
- 🏗️ **Linked sequence**: A codependent request environment in which old requests cannot overlap new ones.
